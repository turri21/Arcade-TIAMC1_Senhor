## Introduction

This is the TIA-MC1 arcade from USSR for the [MiSTer board](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel).

All information taken from [mame/tiamc1.cpp](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/drivers/tiamc1.cpp). Many thanks to Shiru, Eugene Sandulenko and all the other contributors.

## The MiSTer Core

There may still be a few things off.

The first 2 buttons are for game inputs, the 3rd is used for coin.

Gorodki uses a single axis for analog input, the core supports joystick x axis, paddle or spinner. See OSD for config.
